In order to categorize emotions, this work uses preprocessing methods and a modified RoBERTa model. Text samples with seven different emotions from the goEmotion dataset were utilized for training and testing. Among the preparation operations carried out on the text data were the removal of stop words, punctuation, special characters, emojis, URLs, and numbers. The improved RoBERTa model, which now contains three more fully connected layers, was fine-tuned using optimized hyperparameters. Increased accuracy was seen in the trial outcomes when compared to the baseline methodology. The paper lays the framework for future research in this field by highlighting the relevance of preprocessing and model customization in order to increase the effectiveness of emotion categorization.
